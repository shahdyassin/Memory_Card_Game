* <h2>Memory Matching Game</h2>

This project is a simple Memory Matching Game implemented in x86 Assembly language using the TASM assembler. 

The game challenges the player to match pairs of cards by remembering their positions. 

The project highlights the fundamental use of Assembly language for implementing logical operations and interacting with the user via a text-based interface.

* How the Game Works :-

- The board consists of 8 cards, represented as asterisks (*) initially.
  
- The player is prompted to reveal two positions (1-8) on each turn.
  
- If the cards at the selected positions match, they remain revealed.
  
- The game continues until all pairs of cards are matched.
  
- Once all pairs are found, the program displays a congratulatory message.

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of Assembly programming and showcases how a logical problem can be tackled at the low-level with careful memory and register management.

Thanks For Playing , Hope You Enjoy It ! :)
